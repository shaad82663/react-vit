create amplify in project
npm create spmplify@latest

npm ampx sandbox

npx ampx sandbox delete

Infra as code

What is IAC ?

U don't have to mange things (e.g. server, s3)
audtimatuin
scalabilty and collaboration


e.g. Cloudformation -> aws cloude dev kit cdk -> amplify. (amplify is high level a straction)


1. Cloudformation

JSON/YAML file (resources e.g. s3)
we specify resirces and other things in json or yaml config
by outpus file can get all info

e.g. below is exampple for file. Got cloud formation and create stack 

{
    "Resources": {
        "HelloBucket": {
            "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
            "Properties": {
                "LifecycleConfiguration": {
                    "Rules": [
                        {
                            "ExpirationInDays": 3,
                            "Status": "Enabled"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "Outputs": {
        "HelloBucketNameOutput": {
            "Description": "Name of the created S3 bucket",
            "Value": { "Ref": "HelloBucket" }
        }
    }
}


2. CDK : Abstraction over cloud formation - write CF template as code
So dev can wirte CF configs using code 

Dev write cod (in prog lang e.g. typescript, python etc )e -> JSII compiler compiles code -> typescript code -> execut -> cloudformatio template 

Stesp from writeing code to get cf file is cakked synthesize process 

For this we need to install cdk in machine first
sudo npm i -g aws-cdk


 cdk init app --language=typescript 

 (do cdk init -> for more options)
 write config  in lib/
 cdk synth -> cf config is geenated 
 cdk bottstrap (what this ?) (one time process at a)
